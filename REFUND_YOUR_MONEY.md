# How to Get Your Money Back

## Your Current Situation
- ₦150 was deducted from your wallet
- Money is held in escrow (not given to seller yet)
- You can cancel the escrow and get your money back

## Option 1: Cancel Escrow & Get Refund (RECOMMENDED)

### Steps:
1. Go to `/escrow` page in the app
2. Find your escrow transaction
3. Click "Cancel" button
4. Money will be refunded to your wallet immediately

### What Happens:
- ✅ Money returned to your wallet
- ✅ Escrow cancelled
- ✅ No charges or fees
- ✅ Seller gets notification that you cancelled

## Option 2: Contact Seller & Complete Purchase

### Steps:
1. Go to the listing page
2. Click "Message Seller" button
3. Ask if they're available to deliver
4. If yes, wait for them to deliver
5. Confirm receipt in escrow page
6. Money released to seller

## Option 3: Admin Refund (If Cancel Doesn't Work)

If you can't cancel through the app, I can help:
1. Tell me your user ID or username
2. I'll manually cancel the escrow
3. Money will be refunded immediately

## Important Notes

### Escrow Status Meanings:
- **PENDING** - Waiting for seller to accept (can cancel)
- **FUNDED** - Money held, waiting for delivery (can cancel)
- **DELIVERED** - Seller marked as delivered (can confirm or dispute)
