CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION:

ClanPlug is a social platform with integrated services. Here's what you need to know:

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Frontend: Next.js deployed on Vercel (https://clanplug.vercel.app)
- Backend: Express/Node.js on Render (https://clanplug-o7rp.onrender.com)
- Database: PostgreSQL on Render
- Media: Cloudinary for images

RECENTLY COMPLETED (Nov 14, 2025):
✅ TikTok-style feed algorithm - Posts mixed so no consecutive posts from same user
✅ Removed stories section - Cleaner interface
✅ Added Favorites tab - Users can bookmark and view favorite posts
✅ Fixed chat 400 error - Proper validation for participants array
✅ Added follow/message buttons - One-click actions on each post in feed
✅ Improved layout - Single column, centered, professional design

KEY FILES:
- web/src/app/feed/page.tsx - Social feed with TikTok algorithm
- src/services/post.service.ts - getSocialFeed() method with mixing logic
- src/controllers/chat.controller.ts - Chat creation with validation
- PROJECT_HANDOFF.md - Complete documentation
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Quick commands and fixes

CURRENT STATUS:

- Follow/message buttons functional

DEPLOYMENT:
- Frontend: Auto-deploys via Vercel CLI
- Backend: Auto-deploys on git push to main
- Both are currently live and working

WHAT TO SAY TO CONTINUE:
"I'm continuing work on ClanPlug. Last session we implemented TikTok-style feed algorithm, removed stories, added favorites tab, and fixed chat creation. Everything is deployed. What should we work on next?"

OR if there are issues:
"I'm seeing [describe issue] on ClanPlug. Last session we worked on the feed algorithm and chat system. Can you help debug?"

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Database is on Render (not local)
- Cloudinary is configured for media uploads
- All API endpoints use Bearer token authentication
- Feed endpoint is /api/posts/feed (not /api/posts?type=SOCIAL_POST)
- Chat creation requires participants array: { type: 'DIRECT', participants: [userId] }
